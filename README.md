This repository contains my solutions for the KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship, aimed at providing practical insights into the work done at KPMG and enhancing career skills and experience.

## Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories organization, approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team to leverage KPMG's expertise in Analytics, Information & Modelling. The internship is divided into three tasks:

## Module 1: Data Quality Assessment
The goal of this task was to analyze data quality issues in the given datasets. It involved identifying discrepancies and suggesting ways to overcome them to ensure smoother analysis in the future. Proficiency in Excel, particularly using filters and functions, was required. Communication of findings was done via email to the client.

## Module 2: Data Insights
In this module, the objective was to gather insights about potential customers by studying their past behavior. Data analysis strategies were developed, considering factors such as age distribution, number of purchases in the last three years, job industry category, wealth segment, and number of cars owned. A presentation was created to showcase the data analysis strategies and their results, helping the client identify their target customers.

## Module 3: Data Presentation
The focus of this module was to present the findings from the previous task, including target customers, top 10 goods, customer demographics, and spending habits. Data visualization techniques were employed using tools like Power BI and Tableau to create an interactive dashboard for effective data presentation.
